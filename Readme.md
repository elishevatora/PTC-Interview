# India Covid Graph : PTC Interview

### Presentation
This application is under angularjs.
It represents the covid cases in India according to a chosen period.
It is responsive (mobile, desktop)


It is composed of two parts:
- The left one: where the user can make his choices
- The one on the right: a dynamic graph that illustrates the user's choices

The user has 4 possible choices:
- Label search: the user can write a name of a city in India to filter and find more easily the city in question
- Dropdown: 4 possibilities: "Active", "Deaths", "Recovered", "Confirmed
- Datepicker: the user can choose a time period
- List: the list consists of cities in India. the user can select/unselect (checkbox) a city to get more information under it.

By default, the graph shows the deaths in all Indian cities between January 2020 and January 2021


> Please note: I recommend not to give the api https://exchangeratesapi.io/ for the following interviews because even if you register the site does not give access to all the information needed to do this work.
So I took this api from covid in India https://api.rootnet.in/



# Bonus features:

  - Search 
  - Datepicker range 
  - Checkbox of city selected
